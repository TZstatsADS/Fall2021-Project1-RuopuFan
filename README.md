### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Project title: Exploring Philosophy Texts
+ This project is conducted by Ruopu Fan

+ Project summary: In this project, we are going to have a look at modern philosophy and the texts by main thinkers (e.g. Immanuel Kant). Going through the exploratory data analysis along with visualizations, one will have an idea about the most important words and topics in philosophy books.
